My project is a basic command line calculaor which performs basic function 
it performs addition subtraction multiplication division and for real numbers
it also performs factorial ,power and modulus
it performs basic trignometric function like sin , cos,tan sec,cosec,cot,ln,log
it performs hyperbolic and arc(inverse) of the above trignometric function
it also support exp , sqrt, ceil, fabs, floor;
it also has the feature of scale for accuracy
which is required for division
if code seg faults run it again pls.
commands 't' present time .'c' clear screen for understanding .'d' fot exit. -h for help argunment 
also converts binary to decimal and decimal to binary. commands bas () .provide space for the token seperation ....
initially scale set to 0.
added a feature can performs matrix operation addition subtraction .... input not provided..through file handling.
and all the cases not handled.advantage can be used to calculate numbers of unlimited length with time complexicity of n - n^2.
